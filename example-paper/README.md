Example paper
=============

- [`paper.tex`](paper.tex): LaTeX source for the paper
- [`supplement.tex`](supplement.tex): LaTeX source for the supplements
- [`references.bib`](references.bib): BibTeX source for the bibliography
- [`data`](data/): directory for the (raw) data files
- [`config`](config/): directory for configuration files

In addition, we should have
- a `Makefile`, scripting the paper preparation workflow, i.e.
  - running the analysis
  - creating figures
  - typesetting the paper
- alternatively, a section in this README could describe how to do the above
  in prose text.
- a directory for
  - results of the analysis
  - figures
- the final output of the workflow
  - `paper.pdf`
  - `supplement.pdf`
