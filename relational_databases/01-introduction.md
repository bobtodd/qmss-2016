# Introduction

The [software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) lesson on 
[Databases and SQL](http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/) describes relational
databases as

> a way to store and manipulate information. Databases are arranged as tables. Each table 
> has columns (also known as fields) that describe the data, and rows (also known as records) 
> which contain the data.

> When we are using a spreadsheet, we put formulas into cells to calculate new values based 
> on old ones. When we are using a database, we send commands (usually called queries) to a 
> database manager: a program that manipulates the database for us. The database manager does 
> whatever lookups and calculations the query specifies, returning the results in a tabular 
> form that we can then use as a starting point for further queries.

> Queries are written in a language called SQL, which stands for “Structured Query Language”. 
> SQL provides hundreds of different ways to analyze and recombine data. We will only look at 
> a handful of queries, but that handful accounts for most of what scientists do.

Using relational databases is motivated as follows:

> Three common options for storage are text files, spreadsheets, and databases. Text files 
> are easiest to create, and work well with version control, but then we would have to build 
> search and analysis tools ourselves. Spreadsheets are good for doing simple analyses, but 
> they don’t handle large or complex data sets well. Databases, however, include powerful 
> tools for search and analysis, and can handle large, complex data sets. These lessons will 
> show how to use a database to explore [...] data.
