### Exploring patterns in large datasets

Theory and Background
- The lecture presentation for [Sean's session](https://github.com/shh-dlce/qmss-2016/blob/master/talkSlides/QMSS_Roberts.pdf) discussed big data sets.  It argued that quantitative methods can help ask new kinds of questions, engage a wider range of researchers and lead to more reproducible and transparent studies. But dealing with big data also has problems, including spurious patterns driven by historical relations.  The arguments are summarised [here](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-124819)  
- If you are unfamiliar with the R language, it is recommended that you take the short introduction to R tutorial.  It takes a few hours and teaches the basics of using the language. Sean is happy to help with any technical problems or questions you have about R.  Please contact him by email.

Practical session
- Sean is on hand to discuss how you can use quantitative measures to interrogate your data to answer your research questions.  Topics include permutation tests, random independent sample tests (see the intro to R advance topics), and Random Forest analyses.  Also happy to discuss extracting data from various sources (e.g. the internet) and converting it into usable formats.
