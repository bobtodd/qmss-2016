### Phylogenetic Comparative Methods for Discrete Data  

Theory and Background  
- The lecture presentation for Fiona's PCM session (QMSS16 Phylogenetic Comparative Methods Discrete.pdf) is in the QMSS folder "talkSlides". There are no accompanying notes but references to empirical literature are given on each slide for you to follow up, and some of this material will be covered briefly in the masterclass.     
- You should have followed the Phylogenetic Inference / Tree-building materials from Simon Greenhill before going through these materials AND you should go through these materials before moving on to Annemarie Verkerk's PCM for Continuous Character Data.  
- There is a "BeginnerBayes" short lecture presentation in the "talkSlides" folder as well.  Depending on demand from participants I may re-run this session during the masterclass. You are welcome to make your way through it, though it needs narration.
 
Practical session  
- Files for Fiona's practical session are in /exercises  
- Handbook for practical exercises is a pdf in this directory.  
There are more practical exercises in the handbook than we covered in the QMSS session. The first three sessions are on Viewing Trees in FigTree, Nexus format, and SplitsTree. You should be able to follow these on your own after the Phylogenetic Inference session.  
The handbook and exercises are pretty much completely self-explanatory and can be used as a standalone workbook. Please work through at your own pace, and if you are stuck with software or file issues please contact Fiona on email. I'm happy to "check your answers" as well. Questions about applications to your own data should be saved up for the Masterclass!
