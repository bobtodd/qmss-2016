### Phylogenetic Comparative Methods for Discrete Data  

Theory and Background  
- The lecture presentation for Fiona's PCM session is in the QMSS folder "lecture_slides"  
- You should have followed the Phylogenetic Inference / Tree-building materials from Simon Greenhill before going through these materials.
- You should go through these materials before moving on to Annemarie Verkerk's PCM for Continuous Character Data.  
- 
Practical session  
- Files for Fiona's practical session are in /exercises  
- Handbook for practical exercises is a pdf in this directory.  
There are more practical exercises in the handbook than we will get through in the session. The first three sessions are on Viewing Trees in FigTree, Nexus format, and SplitsTree. You should be able to follow these on your own after the Phylogenetic Inference session.  
  
NOTE there is a late addition to the software downloads: **Mesquite** (version 3.04)  
This is GUI software for visualizing and analyzing comparative data on phylogenies.

Youâ€™ll also need Java 7 or 8.
