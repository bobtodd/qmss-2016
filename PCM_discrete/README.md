### Phylogenetic Comparative Methods for Discrete Data  

- Files for Fiona's practical session are in /exercises  
- Handbook for practical exercises  
There are more practical exercises in the handbook than we will get through in the session. The first three sessions are on Viewing Trees in FigTree, Nexus format, and SplitsTree. You should be able to follow these on your own after the Phylogenetic Inference session.  
  
NOTE there is a late addition to the software downloads: **Mesquite** (version 3.04)  
This is GUI software for visualizing and analyzing comparative data on phylogenies.

Youâ€™ll also need Java 7 or 8.
