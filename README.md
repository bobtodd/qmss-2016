  - Robert Forkel (Databases and GutHub version control)  
  - Sean Roberts (statistical modelling)  
  - Chiara Barbieri (genetics)

  - Fiona Jordan (phylogenetic comparative methods)
  
## Preparation

- Create an account on github.com
- Install git or GitHub Desktop and
- (optional) if you know how, clone this repository to your own computer. Highly recommended rather than downloading separate files, this will give you a mirror of this repository (qmss-2016) on your own machine. Some simple instructions are [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/). 

## Tutorials  
You will need to download the zipfile if you have not cloned the repository. 

- [IntroToR](IntroToR/) or [zipfile](IntroToR/QMSS_IntroToR.zip)
- [IntroToStats](IntroToStats/) or [zipfile](IntroToStats/QMSS_IntroToStats.zip)
 
## Tutor Presentations and Materials  
Most presentations are in the folder [talkSlides](talkSlides/). Tutors have a "readme.md" file in their respective tutorial directories that give you further information about their materials and contact details.
